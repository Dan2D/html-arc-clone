                        ARC Architects has worked with many public agencies and 
                        non-profits for programming, planning, and feasibility studies. 
                        We know how to bring together multiple stakeholders and develop 
                        direction and consensus.

                    <p>
                        Successful facility and site planning requires knowledge of program needs, 
                        agency mission, public perception and input, and an understanding of site 
                        attributes, such as zoning, sensitive areas, climate, topography, 
                        connectivity, and infrastructure. We start with existing studies, site maps, 
                        and drawings to understand issues that frame the planning effort and look 
                        for constraints and opportunities for the site. Key stakeholders are 
                        interviewed to understand and define the program. In addition to interviews 
                        and public input, we have consultants who provide demographics, market 
                        analysis, and cost recovery projections.

                    Early design work is critical to the success of every project. 
                    We collaborate with our clients to develop concept designs and 
                    images that define their goals and site potential. Budgets are 
                    crafted, refined, and adjusted to meet fundraising needs. 
                    Our extensive experience working through this process, generating 
                    multiple options and ideas, and guiding the decision making, 
                    gives our clients confidence in their successful development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We develop concept options with out clients’ input and facilitate 
                    public meetings as needed. Our team is experienced with public 
                    meetings and working within the public process to gather the 
                    necessary input from the community, staff, and key decision makers.

                <p>
                    We begin the permit process with early meetings with City Permit Agencies.
                    Their review and input in the early stages is important for all projects.
                    Often times projects have special circumstances that the design team needs
                    to negotiate with permit agencies.  ARC is well experienced with working
                    with local and state codes to develop options to meet client needs.

                    Construction documents include the drawings and product specifications, 
                    and we work diligently to provide quality documents to the contractors.  
                    ARC has developed good working relationships with many contractors.  
                    We bring an attitude of shared responsibility to the table and appreciate 
                    the contractor's input during design and work together to solve issues during construction.

                            An efficient building design can help reduce energy and water use, 
                            improve indoor air quality, and minimize materials use. ARC Architects 
                            has a long history of integrating sustainable design into its projects 
                            by considering the relationship between first costs, long-term costs, 
                            and the benefits of environmentally responsible design. This integrated 
                            design approach connects the site to the building and its users. We are 
                            committed to incorporating sustainable and durable design into every project.

                    Designing projects so that all visitors feel comfortable 
                    and welcome is something that ARC Architects strives to do in 
                    each of our projects. Complying with ADA/ABA standards is standard 
                    for every projects. We have been involved in numerous renovation 
                    projects that required bringing projects into compliance. 
                    Careful in-field assessment and documentation of existing 
                    conditions such as parking, walkways, doors, restrooms and 
                    fixtures is key to successful implementation of the necessary 
                    improvements to create safe and universal accessible places. 
                    ARC has a multi-year on-call contract with City of Seattle to 
                    review ADA and other accessibility requirements for public projects 
                    designed for the city.

                        ARC Architects has significant experience in existing building condition 
                        assessments and budget planning, which are important for organizations to 
                        maintain their buildings and plan for future renovations and repairs. 
                        All renovation projects begin with an assessment of the existing building, 
                        the envelope, mechanical and electrical systems, code issues, and finishes. 
                        Through this assessment process we discuss options for renovation and upgrades 
                        to existing systems. With an understanding of the potential costs, the team 
                        can prioritize the required work and determine a long-term asset management 
                        plan in order to extend the life of the building.

                    <p>
                        At times the assessment determines that renovation will be more expensive than 
                        replacement.  Depending on the design of the existing building, the additional 
                        expense may be worth the cost to save a historic structure or important community 
                        resource. Our experience provides us the necessary tools to quickly assess and 
                        help define scope of future planning and budgets.
